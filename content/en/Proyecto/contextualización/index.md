As part of our efforts to ensure that the production, communication, and application of scientific and technical knowledge are globally equitable, it is essential to be able to share accessible resources for Spanish-speaking communities.

The "Contextualization" project begins in response to the need to organize efforts to develop quality resources in Spanish from material originally in another language, where quality does not only imply a correct translation of the content but also its adaptation to the regional context in a way that is accessible and meaningful.

Although this project begins with the more immediate goal of contextualizing material in English, it is not limited to that. We also hope to share our work methodology and open it up to the community.
