In 2022, MetaDocencia embarked on a process of collective and collaborative learning to design our governance. The goal was to develop a transparent model for strategic decision-making, designed from and for our cultural and regional context.

After

- 32 internal activities,
- 8 open meetings,
- 7 experts and specialists who joined to participate,
- 10 actively involved individuals,
- +55 hours of synchronous work,
- +4 months of exchange...

... we reached consensus and defined an internal working method, functioning bodies, and collaboration guidelines.

The implementation of our new governance began in December 2022, with the formation of a new Advisory Council (CA) and the call for a first meeting according to the updated operating principles. The CA, along with the Management, Coordination, and other working teams, collaborate to ensure that decision-making and activity development enhance MetaDocencia's work and mission.

We plan to review the governance after its first year in practice, so it will also be a challenge to maintain an open perspective and allow ourselves to question what does not work.

In 2023, we will publish and make available the functioning bases of our governance.

Thanks to all the people and communities who participated in and supported the development of this great collective learning process! ðŸ’ª
