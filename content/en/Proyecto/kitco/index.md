The project “Structure and infrastructure for pedagogical training through virtual cohorts” begins as a need for MetaDocencia to transform ourselves by directing our courses and workshops from a few hours to cohorts of several weeks.

We designed this document as a public, shareable, and reusable guide on how to develop cohorts with adaptable resources to be applied in new and different experiences. The document presents a series of tools, resources, and templates that are open, free, collaborative, and adapted to the cultural and social context of Spanish-speaking countries.

Each tool is accompanied by an introduction that explains its usefulness, instructions on how to use it, and additional resources to delve into the topic, including practical examples.

We hope that this Cohort Kit (KitCo) will contribute to other communities being able to develop cohorts adapted to their contexts, environments, and particularities, thus fostering collaboration and growing the project for the benefit of many more people.
