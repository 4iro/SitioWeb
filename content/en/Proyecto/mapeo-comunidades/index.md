This proposal, conceived by Patricia Loto, Jesica Formoso, and Irene Vazano, consists of an interactive application developed using the Shiny package in the R programming language to provide information related to resources, events, workshops, funding opportunities, and open science communities in Latin America. This project was born at the beginning of 2023 from our desire to orient our practice towards open science with a local perspective and will be open to anyone interested in accessing resources on open science, connecting with other regional and local actors, or even participating in the promotion of open practices. It was developed in the context of the [OLS Cohort 7](https://openlifesci.org/openseeds/ols-7/projects-participants.html#projects "OLS Cohort 7 Projects").

Expected outcomes:

* Provide information related to resources, events, and open science communities in Latin America
* Store and centralize updated and curated information that is easily accessible to anyone interested in the topic
* Showcase the diversity of initiatives and even generate contact networks that enrich the exercise of open science in the region

### MOTIVATION

#### Promote Collaboration and Networking

The repository as a virtual meeting point for researchers, institutions, and organizations offers a comprehensive directory of open science communities, facilitating networking, promoting interdisciplinary collaborations, and the exchange of best practices, eliminating geographical barriers, and fostering knowledge dissemination.

#### Showcase Scientific Contributions from Latin America

It will be a platform to highlight significant contributions made in the region, making it easily accessible to the scientific community at large. By centralizing information about communities, resources, events, and funding opportunities, the repository will increase visibility and recognition of the region's scientific achievements.

#### Facilitate Access to Resources

The repository will address challenges such as limited access to funding, infrastructure, and training opportunities by providing a curated collection of resources, including funding databases, open-access journals, data repositories, and educational materials, serving as an information source for researchers and institutions to more effectively adopt open science practices.

#### Empower Early-Stage Researchers

We recognize the importance of supporting the next generation of scientists by providing dedicated resources and mentoring programs to support their development. By connecting them with established researchers and providing guidance on open science methodologies, the repository will bridge the gap between experienced and emerging scientists, thus promoting the growth of open science in the region.
