As part of the Transform to Open Science (TOPS) initiative, a comprehensive program of activities by NASA to support the advancement of science towards openness, MetaDocencia trains Spanish-speaking science and technical personnel to transform their daily work into Open Science through training cohorts called Latin America Transforms to Open Science (ALTa, by its acronym in Spanish).

Each cohort includes Open Science training covering the five modules of Open Science 101, building contextualized knowledge around different topics with a local perspective, and thinking about situations and examples from our experience in Latin America.

### Objectives
* Develop contextualized and accessible versions of NASA TOPSâ€™ Open Science 101 modules for Spanish-speaking audiences.
* Annually update the Open Science 101 modules of NASA TOPS in their contextualization for Spanish-speaking audiences.
* Promote NASA TOPS in low-resource research environments through conference presentations, publications, press releases, social media, and community activities.
* Train 6 weeks of virtual cohorts with these contents.
* Foster an online community of Spanish speakers that is supportive and inclusive, around NASA TOPS training.
