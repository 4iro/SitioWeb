As part of the Transform to Open Science (TOPS) initiative, a comprehensive program of activities by NASA to support the advancement of science towards openness, MetaDocencia will train Spanish-speaking science and technical personnel to transform their daily work into open science.

Our proposal includes open science training through virtual cohorts for Spanish speakers. It will cover the five modules of Open Science 101, and each participant will work with a mentor to discuss the real-world application of knowledge over 6 weeks.

### Objectives
* Develop contextualized and accessible versions of NASA TOPS' Open Science 101 modules for Spanish-speaking audiences.
* Annually update the Open Science 101 modules of NASA TOPS in their contextualization for Spanish-speaking audiences.
* Promote NASA TOPS in low-resource research environments through conference presentations, publications, press releases, social media, and community activities.
* Train virtual cohorts with these contents. Each cohort will receive 6 weeks of online training covering the complete modules of NASA TOPS' Open Science 101.
* Foster an online community of Spanish speakers, supportive and inclusive, around NASA TOPS training.
