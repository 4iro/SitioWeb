At csv,conf,7, we presented this collaborative effort to showcase and connect efforts to reaffirm, once again, that science is collective work. 

We aspire for the Hive to represent the network of our fellow communities and organizations, each with its own life experience, accent, emotions, and dedication to science and teaching.
