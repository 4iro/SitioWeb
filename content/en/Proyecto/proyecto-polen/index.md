This project was born in early 2023 from our desire to open community pathways to train representatives of MetaDocencia in different communities, networks, and events. The intention is to offer community journeys to expand participation in Open Science communities and to recognize those who participate in the project for their contribution to the growth of our community.

The Polen Project aims to incorporate more people to represent MetaDocencia in external communities, networks, and events, recognizing their contribution to our mission and vision while deepening their community trajectories in MetaDocencia.

The individuals we collaborate with externally multiply and enhance the implementation of MetaDocencia's values of inclusion, diversity, community, and versatility, articulating very valuable interdisciplinary trajectories to extend the networks of community work and participation in Open Science in Spanish-speaking regions.

The Polen Project aims to invite people who approached our community in past calls (2022/2023) and share open activities with them that continue to create bonds with Our Team and the Hive of Friendly Communities.

During late 2023 and 2024, we will carry out the pilot stage of the Polen Project, summoning a small group of people and exploring different forms of participation. Based on what we learn in this pilot stage, we hope to improve it and expand it in future editions!

## Project Objectives
* Open community pathways to train representatives of MetaDocencia in different communities, networks, and events.
* Offer community journeys to expand participation in Open Science communities.
* Recognize those who participate in the project for their contribution to the growth of our community.
