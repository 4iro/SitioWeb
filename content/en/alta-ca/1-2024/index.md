# ALTa Ciencia Abierta 1 2024

Together with NASA, MetaDocencia invites people from **Spanish-speaking communities to join 6-week online training cohorts** to extend the principles of Open Science in Latin America and beyond. 

In addition to teaching NASA TOPS [Open Science 101](https://openscience101.org/), the ALTa Ciencia Abierta mission will contextualize this knowledge to identify and learn about innovative experiences and practices of Open Science specific to the spaces and regions of the people participating in the cohorts. 

**Registration is free and open**, and the cohorts will have a certificate of attendance issued by MetaDocencia, with the option of certifying the Open Science knowledge acquired through NASA. Both cohorts and certifications will be **online and 100% in Spanish**.

## Why participate?

The objective of this training will be to make the NASA Open Science contents dialogue with cases, experiences, and initiatives in Latin America that reify the practice of Open Science.

Participants completing this training will be able to:
- Have a first approach to the Open Science principles, techniques, and tools.
- Participate in a Spanish-speaking exchange space about Open Science.
- Connect with other Spanish-speaking people interested in Open Science.
- Integrate a friendly and safe space for sharing their  Open Science initiatives and projects.
- Update their Open Science knowledge to strengthen their projects and practices.
- Access a certification endorsed by NASA.

### For whom?
MetaDocencia believes in gathering researchers and technicians of all levels and from diverse disciplines. Diversity enriches the conversations and generates exchange spaces that are transversal and open. That contributes to increasing epistemic justice and fostering collaborations between diverse knowledge areas.

We hope that Spanish-speaking researchers and technicians can join us if they:
- Are interested in approaching, curious to debate, or to build knowledge about Open Science in Spanish-speaking contexts. If this is your first approach to Open Science, it will be an honor to count you among the participants in the course!
- Have participated in Citizen Science, networks, events, or communities associated with these topics;
- Have some (considering a wide range between a little and a lot) experience working in open initiatives such as publications, data, research, archives, or repositories, among others;
- Teach or disseminate science and technology in a teaching or communications role.

### What does this training *not* include?
- In-depth development and extensive practice of Open Science principles.
- Theory of science or epistemology.
- Use of Open Science focused on specific disciplines.

## Duration
Each cohort will have **one 3-hour-long synchronous online meeting per week during 6 weeks**, with breaks away from the screen every approximately 50 minutes.

During the meetings, we will reflect on the five NASA TOPS Open Science 101 course modules. They will include activities to promote exchange, discussion among peers in breakout rooms, and presentation of initiatives or projects of those who attend.

## Schedule
The first meeting will introduce the key concepts of the module, term definitions, and the importance of contextualization. We will also explain the modality of the meetings and the communication channels. In modules 2 to 5, we will present a case or project with a Latin American perspective to illustrate the recommendations on the subject with contextualized good practices. The sixth meeting is a Plenary of Open Science Initiatives in which the participants of the cohort, as leaders of regional initiatives, will share their experiences and will have the opportunity to exchange ideas and learnings and get in touch with each other to create a community around common interests. In addition, a support space is offered to obtain certification.

To increase the accessibility of this training, we will record each meeting and share the recording the following day. 

## Certification
Those who participate in the course will have access to a **dual certification**:

### NASA TOPS Certification
For obtaining the certificate of the NASA TOPS Open Science 101, it will be necessary to answer correctly 70% of the questions of each of the 5 questionnaires administered at the end of each meeting. The questionnaires will be available in Spanish, and the last part of the synchronous meetings 1 to 5 will be dedicated to answering them. It will be possible to complete these questionnaires asynchronously (up to 7 days after the last meeting) and redo them during meeting six.

### MetaDocencia Certification
MetaDocencia will issue an attendance certificate to those who actively participate, either by attending 4 of the 6 meetings synchronously or by having completed 4 of the 5 questionnaires detailed in the previous paragraph at least 7 calendar days after the date of the last synchronous meeting.

## How to participate
This training will be offered in Spanish.*

*Vacancies are limited for each edition, so we ask you to register **only if you will be able to participate**. In case the quota is full, we will set up a waiting list so that you can join the next cohort.*
