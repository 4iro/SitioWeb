# ALTa Ciencia Abierta 6 2025

**Together with NASA, MetaDocencia invites people from Spanish-speaking communities to join 6-week online training cohorts to extend the principles of Open Science in Latin America and beyond.** 

ALTa Ciencia Abierta (Latin America Transforms to Open Science, by its Spanish acronym) mission focuses on building contextualized knowledge around different topics with a local perspective, thinking about situations and examples from our experience in Latin America.

**The training will be online and 100% in Spanish**.

## Why participate?

Participants completing this training will be able to:
- Double certification MetaDocencia + NASA.
- Have a first approach to the Open Science principles, techniques, and tools.
- Participate in a Spanish-speaking exchange space about Open Science.
- Connect with other Spanish-speaking people interested in Open Science.
- Integrate a friendly and safe space for sharing their Open Science initiatives and projects.
- Update their Open Science knowledge to strengthen their projects and practices.

### For whom?
MetaDocencia believes in gathering researchers and technicians of all levels and from diverse disciplines. Diversity enriches the conversations and generates exchange spaces that are transversal and open. That contributes to increasing [epistemic justice](https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=8022184) and fostering collaborations between diverse knowledge areas.

We hope that Spanish-speaking researchers and technicians can join us if they:
- Are interested in approaching, curious to debate, or to build knowledge about Open Science in Spanish-speaking contexts. If this is your first approach to Open Science, it will be an honor to count you among the participants in the course!
- Have participated in Citizen Science, networks, events, or communities associated with these topics;
- Have some (considering a wide range between a little and a lot) experience working in open initiatives such as publications, data, research, archives, or repositories, among others;
- Teach or disseminate science and technology in a teaching or communications role.

### What does this training *not* include?
- In-depth development and extensive practice of Open Science principles.
- Theory of science or epistemology.
- Use of Open Science focused on specific disciplines.

## Duration
Each cohort will have **one 3-hour-long synchronous online meeting per week during 6 weeks**, with breaks away from the screen every approximately 50 minutes.

During the meetings, we will reflect on the five NASA TOPS Open Science 101 course modules. They will include activities to promote exchange, discussion among peers in breakout rooms, and presentation of initiatives or projects of those who attend.

## Schedule
At each meeting, the key concepts of the module, definitions of terms and cases, or projects with a Latin American perspective are presented to illustrate the recommendations on the subject with contextualized good practices (you can access the roadmap with the contents from the schedule). In the sixth meeting, a Plenary of Open Science Initiatives will be held in Spanish, in which participants will be able to share their experiences and will have the opportunity to exchange learning.

To increase the accessibility of this training, we will record each meeting and share the recording the following day. 

## Certification
Those who participate in the course will have access to a **dual certification**:

### NASA TOPS Certification
For obtaining the certificate of the NASA TOPS Open Science 101, it will be necessary to answer correctly 70% of the questions of each of the 5 questionnaires administered at the end of each meeting. The questionnaires will be available in Spanish, and the last part of the synchronous meetings 1 to 5 will be dedicated to answering them. It will be possible to complete these questionnaires asynchronously (up to 7 days after the last meeting) and redo them during meeting six.

### MetaDocencia Certification
MetaDocencia will issue an attendance certificate to those who actively participate, either by attending 4 of the 6 meetings synchronously or by having completed 4 of the 5 questionnaires detailed in the previous paragraph at least 7 calendar days after the date of the last synchronous meeting.

## How to participate
**This training has an economic value and is supported by our [sponsors](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/sponsors/), so registration, course and certification are free of charge.** 
Vacancies are limited for each edition, **so we ask you to register only if you will be able to actively participate**. In case the quota is full, we will set up a waiting list so that you can join the next edition.

*Registration will open on May 12, 2025.*

This training will be offered in Spanish.
