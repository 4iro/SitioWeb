**Experience and Track Record**

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems and a Diploma in Data Science, Machine Learning and its Applications from the FAMAF of the National University of Cordoba. Since the beginning of 2021 I have been part of the Metadocencia accessibility team and since mid 2023 I have joined the team in charge of Mapping Open Science communities, organizations and resources in Latin America. My passion for learning and collaborating in various fields has led me to be an active part of different communities and mentoring programs. I have participated as a mentee in Open Seeds, a mentoring and training program provided by the Open Life Science (OLS) community during cohort 7, and during cohort 8 I had the opportunity to participate as a mentor. My credentials include certification as an Instructor by The Carpentries and as a tidyverse Instructor by Rstudio, reflecting my commitment to education and empowerment through technology. In addition, I am an active member in communities such as R-Ladies, the Carpentries, Latin-R and The Turing Way, where I contribute to and benefit from community learning.
