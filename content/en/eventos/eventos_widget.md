#### After completing the Exploration Mission, we invite you to continue deepening the debate on Open Science with a Latin American perspective!

This year we will begin teaching principles of Open Science in Spanish and through virtual cohorts lasting several weeks. To prepare for this, throughout February, we collectively completed the original content in English of the [Open Science 101](https://openscience101.org/) course, part of the TOPS (Transform to Open Science) initiative organized by NASA.

In response to our community's desire to deepen discussions in spanish, we have prepared a **new series of Open Science conversations**! In these meetings, we will discuss various topics surrounding Open Science to collectively understand how we learn it, how we apply it, and what it means for our region. We aim to recognize its advantages and potential through debating its scope and possibilities. In the last half hour of each call, we will think about how to understand the Open Science experiences that arise in other regions from our Latin American reality, with a view to contextualizing resources such as the contents of NASA-TOPS Open Science 101.
