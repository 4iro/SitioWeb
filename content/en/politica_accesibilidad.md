# MetaDocencia Accessibility Policy

This accessibility policy aims to ensure and promote the creation of accessible environments that enable all members of our community to participate on equal terms.

To achieve this, it outlines criteria and best practices to ensure everyone can participate and carry out their activities without being hindered by barriers in the work environment.

Through the implementation of this policy, from MetaDocencia we commit to working responsibly on the following points:

- Ensuring that all communications made through our different channels are accessible to all target audiences.

- Taking accessibility standards and criteria into consideration when contracting and acquiring goods and services.

- Training the MetaDocencia members in good accessibility practices to guarantee and encourage the participation of all people.

- Providing inclusive and non-discriminatory services, regardless of age, gender, religion, ethnicity, language, identity, political affiliation, or any individual characteristics of our community members.
